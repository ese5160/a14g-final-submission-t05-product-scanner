## 2. Project Summary
### Device Description
Our device serves as a supermarket product scanner, allowing customers to scan QR codes to access item information such as location, name, and stock quantity displayed on an LCD screen. Supermarket staff can monitor the products scanned by customers and their respective locations via the terminal web page. Moreover, employees can also track the temperature and humidity within the supermarket to assess if environmental adjustments are necessary.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this product mainly came from what we saw in supermarkets with large indoor areas (such as Costco and Walmart). When we shop in these supermarkets, we often encounter the situation where we want to buy a small product, but it is difficult to find the product because the supermarket is too large. Therefore, our team wants to design a device that can scan the product's QR code. After scanning the QR code, the specific location of the item you are looking for, as well as the price and remaining quantity information can be displayed. Additionally, this product has a built-in temperature and humidity sensor. This information will be sent back to the computers of supermarket staff, allowing them to monitor the environment in the supermarket and adjust the air conditioning temperature in time to ensure that the products are fresh enough to prevent deterioration. Therefore, the target customers of this product are the operators of these large supermarkets. It can be installed on supermarket shopping carts for customers to use.
